During the recent presidential debate you may have noticed something white or a yellowish color falling from his nose onto his mouth. Which he proceeded to attempt to ignore while it was on his top lip. However, when it took yet another free fall and landed on his bottom lip. It was just too tempting. He **HAD** to eat it!

I don't understand how anyone could look you in the face and tell you this guy is honest, and would make a great President. When as soon as he was put on the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, and made Chairman, of the Subcommittee on Space, Science, and Competitiveness he let this little gem of a quote slip out. 

In a statement to [Free Wood Post][0], Cruz said:

> This is really my chance to change things around here. Enough of this climate science junk. God is in control, and if he didn't want us to destroy the planet he would've sent a plague or flood or something. And as far as NASA goes, no more wasteful spending! We don't need to explore space. We don't need NASA, because God only created the Earth. It says so right there in the Bible --- God created the Heavens and the Earth. That's it. We need to focus on things right here on this planet like oil, keeping health care from people, and avoiding the needy. Just like the Bible says to. We need to give all that NASA money to the already wealthy. They seem to really know what to do with it. I'm excited for my new role and can't wait to get down to business.

I don't understand how anyone could be advocating for another religious zealot while one still resides in the Whitehouse.
